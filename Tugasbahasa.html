        <p>Setting the Nutrijel:
<br>
            Once boiling, remove the pot from heat and let the mixture cool slightly for about 5 minutes.
            <br>

            Pour the Nutrijel mixture into a pudding mold or bowl, filling it halfway.</p>
            <p>Cooling:
<br>
                Allow the Nutrijel to set at room temperature until it starts to firm up, then place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>Adding the Milk:
<br>
                    After the Nutrijel has set slightly, carefully pour 200 ml of Fisinflag White Milk over the top of the Nutrijel layer.</p>
